# 🌍 World Population Data Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

## 📘 About the Project
This project presents a **World Population Data Analysis Dashboard** built entirely in **Microsoft Excel**.  
It visualizes **global population trends** across different countries and continents, helping identify key insights such as **growth rates**, **population density**, and **global distribution over time**.

The dashboard uses population data from **1970 to 2023**, offering an **interactive and visual representation** of demographic changes worldwide.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
- 📈 Analyze **population growth trends** across countries and continents.  
- 🕰️ Compare **historical population data (1970–2023)**.  
- 🌍 Identify **high-growth regions** and countries with **population decline**.  
- 🧮 Calculate and visualize key demographic indicators:
  - Population density  
  - Growth rate (%)  
  - Share of world population (%)  
  - Area vs. population relationship
